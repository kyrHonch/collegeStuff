This program includes headers stdio, because we need standard io functionality, string.h, because we need a method strstr in order to concatenate and strcmp to count lines, dirent.h in order to use directory stream aka DIR and closedir, and sys/stat.h in order to use opendir
There are 2 methods, count_lines_in_file and a recursive method traverse_directory
The first method takes in the filename, counts, and then returns the number of lines in it by iterating through the file using a while loop validating whether or not the file is empty, and then increasing the line count after every iteration. 
The second method traverse_directory recursively passes through the directory and finds all files ending with .txt, and then passes them to the helper function count_lines_in_file in order to count files. This function works by checking whether or not the given directory is empty, and if is not, then it initiates the while loop. Inside of this while loop it skips over the current and parent directories, if they are not zero, then it executes the code inside, which in turn is used to get length of each individual file.
