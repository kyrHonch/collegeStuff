In this script, there are 4 methods. readFile, writeFile, and multiplyMatrices. 
1. readFile takes in 2 parameters: a file pointer and a 2d array aka a matrix
   1. It opens the file in read binary formats
   2. It checks if the file exists, if it doesn’t, then the program crashes
   3. If it exists, creates n, which equals the first int in the program, which in turn is equal to the dimension of the matrix
   4. Then it iterates through every line, reading in each integer and filling out the matrix with it
   5. Closes the file
   6. Returns the first element
2. writeFile, which takes in 3 parameters: a file pointer, the dimension of the matrix, and a matrix.
   1. This method takes in a matrix and writes it into a binary file, called result.bin, and this method follows the same principle as the first method
3. multiplyMatrices, which takes in 4 parameters: the dimensions of matrices, and 3 2d arrays aka matrices
   1. This method calculates the product of the multiplication of 2 matrices that were passed as arguments to the function
4. main
   1. Initiates matrices
   2. It reads in 2 files called matrix1.bin and matrix2.bin
   3. Validates the dimensions of matrices based on whether their files exist, whether the matrix sizes are the same, and if they are over the MAX_SIZE variable which is 100
   4. Executes method multiplication and then finally executes the writeFile method
