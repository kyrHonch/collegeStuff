In this code, we are implementing a radix sort algorithm. The program takes in standard input from the user from the terminal. The input is unsigned integers. 
First, we define the function countSort, which is a helper function of the function radixSort(). countSort takes in 3 arguments, which are the input number, its length, and the bit number. This function sorts each number in its respective buckets.

The radix sort algorithm, which starts with the least significant digit and works its way up to the most significant, is implemented by this function. It requires the length of the array ("int len") and a pointer to an array of integers ("int *input"). It counts the occurrences of each digit at each position, ranging from the least to the most significant ("count[temp]++"), and then computes the prefix sum of the count array. After that, it stores the array in the "output" array and rearranges it based on the digit at that place. To extract the digit at each location, the "radixsort" function utilizes a bitwise AND operator ("& 0xF") and a bitwise shift operator ("input[index] >> (4 * digitIndex)"). This is possible because the program interprets the integers as being encoded in binary, where each digit consists of four bits. The full array is sorted by repeating the operation for each point of a digit.
